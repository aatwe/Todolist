why create templates
for ex 
if (weekday)
	res.send(weekend.html)
else:
	res.send(weekday.html )



What if you want to send 7 different html files for different day	

For todo list app
suppose we have
home list, todolist, grocery list
contents are similar
not efficient to create separate html files for each
